# Read-and-process-file
This is a simple code for reading an excel file and processing the results using the Pandas library of Python. The program reads the data (name, age, grades etc) for various students from the student_grades.xlsx file and prints the average grade of each student, the average grade of each class as well as the average grade for each field of studies. It also makes some checks if the data have been read correclty and if the sum of the grade weights is equal to one.

Just run the main.py file to execute.
